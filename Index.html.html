Happy Birthday, Judy ❤️✨

Hey wifeyyy, iloveyou so so muchhhh.
You know humare beech kitni cheeze hui hain, kitni bakchodiya, kitni ladayi… and still, after all these saal, we always choose each other.
That’s love.

From 8th till now, you’ve been the closest to me. After all these ups and downs I feel like our bond has become UNBREAKABLE and I hope it stays like this forever.

And Judy… abhi recently, after our patch up, mujhe tumse kuch zyada hi pyaar hogya again. Pehle bhi tha, but woh bestie wala pyaar tha.
Now it’s the real pyaar wala pyaar 😭❤️

Even when I’m busy, playing, studying, listening to songs, or doing anything, you’re ALWAYS on my mind. You make my entire day lighter just with your one smile.

Kaha tha na… “Tu dil hai mera”
Aur us dil ke andar your smile has a special VIP room 😭💗

I still can’t believe I fell in love with my best friend.
But I’m so, so happy it happened.

You’re the most trustworthy, precious partner and WIFE 😝😋 I’ve ever met.

I have so much more to say, but baaki sab call pe sunaya karuga 😋

Have the happiest birthday, baby.
Iloveyou the MOST.
I really hope we celebrate all your future birthdays together…
as HUSBAND AND WIFE 🫶😝💍

You’re 17 now yaaaarrr 🥺
I wish this year brings you all the happiness and everything you’ve wished for.

Happy Birthday again, MERI JAAN 🫶🥰
ILOVEYOUSOMUCHHHH ❤️✨
